# Web Developer Bootcamp

Welcome to the web developer bootcamp where you do the practical work to get ready to actually become a web developer and supercharge your earning potential.

This bootcamp was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Also, this is more practical based rather than theory. If you want to learn the theory, you can google it.

Let's jump right in.
